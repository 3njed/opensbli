Application: 1D wave propagation
================================

Equations
---------

This test case considers the numerical solution of the one-dimensional wave equation, written as

.. math:: \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},

where :math:`u`  is the dispacement and :math:`c`  is a known constant.
