Applications
============

Overview
--------

To showcase some of OpenSBLI's functionality, three applications are presented here.

1D wave propagation
-------------------

The one-dimensional wave equation is written as

.. math:: \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},

where :math:`u`  is the dispacement and :math:`c`  is a known constant.

2D advection-diffusion of a Gaussian bump
-----------------------------------------



3D Taylor-Green vortex
